                <p>As a self-proclaimed foodie and fitness enthusiast, I have a passion for cooking and a huge desire to
                    show that living a healthy lifestyle can actually be easy and fun! Feel free to use the meal guide
                    above to find your new favorite meal ideas or the dietary guides to the right to narrow things down
                    even more!I love to cook, but I haven’t always. In fact, for most of my early adult life, cooking
                    dinner usually meant microwaving a frozen dinner or adding boiling water to something that came from
                    a box. Here are five reasons I think you’ll love my blog, whether you’re a seasoned chef or just
                    starting
                    out:
